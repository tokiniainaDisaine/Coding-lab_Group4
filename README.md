## Introduction

Our project involves developing three shell scripts to manage and analyze simulated heart rate, temperature, and water usage data in a hospital. The scripts handle data recording, log archiving, and remote backups.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following programming languages and technologies:
- shell
- python

## Installation and Setup

### Pre-requisites

Make sure you have python installed, see the **[python official website](https://www.python.org) for more information

### Exciting part

1. Clone this repository into your local linux system 
2. Go to the `Coding-lab_Group4/hospital_data` directory
3. Run all 3 python scripts using `python3 <filename> start`
4. Return to the main directory `Coding-lab_Group4`
5. Run `analyze_logs.sh` or `archive_logs.sh` using `./<shell_script>`
6. Follow the prompt instructions
6. Have fun analyzing and archiving data
7. Feel free to use `python3 <filename> stop` so you don't fill your storage



<!-- **1. Setup Instructions**

Ensure you have the following installed on your Linux system:

Bash shell
SSH access to the remote server
Basic Linux command-line knowledge

**2. Running the Scripts**



Run the heart rate monitoring script:

```./heart_rate_monitor.sh```

The script will prompt for a device name, start logging heart rate data, and run in the background.

To archive the log file, run:

```./archive_log.sh```

The script will rename the log file with a timestamp.

Move the archived logs to a designated directory and back them up to a remote server:

./backup_archives.sh The script will create a backup in a different sandbox where a different user can access the log -->
